# KenPire Mesh Cryptics v1.2.1 – Cryptic Infusion (Rooster Signal)

🚀 First functional cryptic payload embedded into poster art.

## What’s New
- Added RoosterOps trigger payload (`/pulse morning`) into poster metadata, graffiti chevrons, and QR.
- New scripts for embedding, decoding, and triggering the payload.
- Added `cryptic_registry.md` to track nonces, hashes, and signatures.

## How It Works
1. Poster image contains a hidden payload.
2. Bots (or humans) can decode via QR, graffiti, or PNG metadata.
3. Running `rooster_watch.py` validates the poster and crows: **“Good morning, Mesh. Crowww!”**
