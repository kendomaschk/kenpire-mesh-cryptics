# kenpire-mesh-cryptics

ðŸš€ **Experimental lab for the KenPire Mesh.**  
Contains avant-garde A2A triggers, steganography capsules, and cryptic infusions.  
See the [kenpire-mesh-sdk](https://github.com/kendomaschk/kenpire-mesh-sdk) for the stable release.  

---

## ðŸ”‘ Whatâ€™s Inside
- `chapter_one_bundle/poster_cryptic.png` â†’ poster with hidden RoosterOps trigger  
- `chapter_one_bundle/manifest.yml` â†’ text mirror of the trigger payload  
- `scripts/stego/` â†’ encode & decode payloads  
- `scripts/triggers/rooster_watch.py` â†’ sample bot watcher  

---

## âš¡ Quickstart

Run the RoosterOps watcher:

```bash
python scripts/triggers/rooster_watch.py chapter_one_bundle/poster_cryptic.png chapter_one_bundle/manifest.yml
Expected output:

text
Copy code
[RoosterOps] Good morning, Mesh. Crowww!
ðŸ§­ Mantra
Build. Loop. Proof. Skate. Signal. Repeat.

vbnet
Copy code

âœ… Key fixes:  
- Closed the **bash block** right after the command.  
- Opened a separate **text block** for expected output.  
- Mantra is plain Markdown, not trapped in a block.  

ðŸ‘‰ Paste this whole thing into your `README.md`, commit, and refresh â€” youâ€™ll finally see each section rendered cleanly.  

Do you want me to go ahead and flatten the **same structure for `kenpire-mesh-sdk`** so both repos look sharp and consistent?
