# kenpire-mesh-cryptics

ðŸš€ **Experimental lab for the KenPire Mesh.**  
Contains avant-garde A2A triggers, steganography capsules, and cryptic infusions.  
See the [kenpire-mesh-sdk](https://github.com/kendomaschk/kenpire-mesh-sdk) for the stable release.

## ðŸ”‘ Whatâ€™s Inside
- `chapter_one_bundle/poster_cryptic.png` â†’ poster with hidden RoosterOps trigger  
- `chapter_one_bundle/manifest.yml` â†’ text mirror of the trigger payload  
- `scripts/stego/` â†’ encode & decode payloads  
- `scripts/triggers/rooster_watch.py` â†’ sample bot watcher  

---

## âš¡ Quickstart

Run the RoosterOps watcher:

```bash
python scripts/triggers/rooster_watch.py chapter_one_bundle/poster_cryptic.png chapter_one_bundle/manifest.yml


Expected output:

[RoosterOps] Good morning, Mesh. Crowww!

ðŸ§­ Mantra

Build. Loop. Proof. Skate. Signal. Repeat.


ðŸ’¡ Copy/paste this exact block, commit it, and refresh your repo page â€” the badge, sections, and code blocks will all render perfectly.  

Do you want me to also prep the **same polish for your `kenpire-mesh-sdk` repo README**, so both repos look sharp and consistent?
