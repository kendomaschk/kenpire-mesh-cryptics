# Contributing to KenPire Mesh Cryptics

This repo is an **experimental lab** for avant-garde features. Contributions are welcome, but must follow these principles:

1. **No Lies Filter** — All commits must be truthful in scope, content, and intent.
2. **Loop Until Done** — Contributions must include automated tests or demo scripts to prove functionality.
3. **ProofLock Required** — Every contribution must include a ProofLock hash (SHA256) in the commit message footer.
4. **Bot Persona Aware** — Contributions must respect the personality codex (Orchestrator, Jarvess, ClauseWitch, RoosterOps, etc.).
5. **Review Rule** — All pull requests must be reviewed by at least one other collaborator (human or bot).

## How to Contribute
- Fork the repo
- Create a feature branch (`feat/my-experiment`)
- Ensure ProofLock hash is present in commit
- Submit a pull request for review

Any attempt to remove or bypass IP protections will result in rejection and revocation of access.
